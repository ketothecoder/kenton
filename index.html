<h1 class="LittleLower">Kenton's Mini Website</h1>
<hr>
<p>I've created this <a href="https://kenton.pages.dev">website</a> in order to display knowledge concerning Global Warming.  However, since I am learning HTML and CSS, perhaps Javascript later on, 
This website will temporarily have randomness as I learn to code and apply my knowledge onto this website.</p>

<h2 class="LittleLower">My looks on coding</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Coding is fun to learn, especially easy languages like website designing.
However along the way, there are difficulties and challenges in coding that help you stay interested and captivated.  But most of the time, I ball up my fists in frustration because of the confusion HTML brings.

<p>HTML isn't just one language that constructs most website.  Other languages like CSS help decorate and improve its looks, thought it's not a programming language but a stylesheet language</p>
